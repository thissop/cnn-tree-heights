see thoughts/problems in description 

- wait could this be a confoundig problem: ellipsoidal shaped crowns? they would pose an espessially troublesome problem if the long axis of the ellipsoid (semi major axis? lol) is oriented parallel to the direction of the shadow, which would result in unrealistic height (because our method assumes circular crowns)?

- yeah definitely seeing how the crown annotations are getting shifted back from the ndvi maximum...i like annotating on pan more. 

- the annotations thus far are the low hanging fruits that I felt like I could definitly see a difference between crown and shadow in the pan, as well as being definitly one tree (i avoided annotated oblong elipsoidal trees because I wasn't sure if we should treat thenm as one or two yet)

- the trees in my cutout_0 set in the village are a lot nicer to annotate than the trees in the previous cutout I was working on yesterday (cutout_1). They're bigger, have more distinct differences between tree crown and shadow, etc. 

- the trees in cutout_3 are kinda hard to annotate because it's hard to make out the crowns (bright in pan, harder to separate from )

about to take a break from annotating to test ankit's code on my shadows data (crown+shadow)

yeah....need to email about model...really weird, but data is good.
