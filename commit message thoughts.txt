my new method slows me down because I have to use ndvi to get middle of tree (so the annotation starts at the crown center), and then go to ndvi to make sure it's tight...but higher quality annotations? 

- couldn't this stuff be corrected afterwards? I think yes, but we don't enough (if any) have reliable ground data to correct them on, and at the end of the day we want accurate predictions (who would be interested in us accurately predicted incorrect things?)...so I guess for now I need to use this more intense method? maybe a way to speed it up is to split screen and have one that's just ndvi, and one that's just pan. ugh. turns out you can't open more than one project at a time...we'll see if there's a good way to do this?

- either way,
