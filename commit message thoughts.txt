I can't see why the issue would be in addToResult, so I think it's some step in preprocssing with the model. 

okay so confirmed problem happens after the selection step of load_train_test

wait...how can it be predicting wrong if it's predicting the correct ish ... wait idk if that's right...this train of thought is not good haha.
