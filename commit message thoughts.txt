plotted and confirmed...for some reason model is predicting the negative? 

inverted the detected mask during the write? 

detected_mask[detected_mask<th]=1
detected_mask[detected_mask>=th]=0 # THIS HAS BEEN INVERTED! MIGHT NEED TO FIX LATER!! 

that is not a good solution. a. doesn't fix root problem...at least we know now problem starts after preprocessing (based on qgis screenshot of png annotations) and before writing to disk

as I'm debugging, switching things to geoparquet 

problem doesn't happen in writeMaskToDisk before mask_to_polygon

problem traces earliest back to detect_tree...could be in that or before 

maybe it's in addToResult?
