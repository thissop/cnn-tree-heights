could ndvi/pan/boundaries/annotations be getting switched around somewhere? 
one thing I'm doing is going through and defining all arguments in function calls explicitly in case the ^^ is an issue. 
no more augmentation on training data for now. 

data isn't the problem right??? check after next check. 

okay....data might be the problem? ndvi and pan look identical?? ... yep confirming this is an issue UGGHHHH why did I make this mistake...

I think I just saw a spot in the preprocessing where it was writing the ndviImg data to the pan img file?? I thought we fixed that previously??
