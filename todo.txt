Meeting Notes
-------------

> NIGHT: 

> things to annotate: #4, #5, 10, 18, 

> fix preprocessing vector rectangle from the wk2 april fix

> make and send videos! 


> update read me 

> ask about scholarship and submit my end of stuff!

> save and find polygons that aren't valid (save lines and polys gdf used in intersection between them)...can't have self interections!

> we need an optional validation step before creating raster annotations in preprocessing so we know the polygons are good before making them rasters!

> https://geopandas.org/en/stable/docs/reference/api/geopandas.GeoSeries.is_valid.html

> lines aren't long enough? how to scale them better? 

> at this point, the main tasks are going to be making more annotations, training network, seeing how it predicts, and then making tweaks based on this

> look into why ground truth is so far from true heights! (and why so many 0s)

> make a bunch of annotations this week for him!
