meta data in mosaic file is half-true, half-ommission (accounts for only one of the cut lines)
the geometry file will tell you meta data per satilite image that was incorporated into the satilte tile
hence, I should probably 
technically can be arbitrary number of satilite images that overlap 
zip archive of cutline data, so I can incorporate this into my pipeline for getting lat/longs
will be interesting algo optimization 
good for parallelizing 
slow part could be assosc between cutline and satilite geometry (two trees next to eachother, but diff sun satilite geos)

past approach: used a regression to map poly to a geo that represesented the shadow ... 
polynomial was really brittle...benefit of using CNN
construct good training set....geo is more or less solved?
shadow length: take length of shadow in length of sun. 

weekend: finish transitioning old library 
    he'll send me geo file, I'll work with it (he calls it a cut line file)
    he'll send resources about previous approach (doesn't seem like good use of time to look through rough code)

don't work on parrelization rn, just work on getting preprocessing back and working (on this computer!)
