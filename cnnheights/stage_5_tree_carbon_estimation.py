#TODO(Jesse): This script is to co-register the tree height database with the tree crown database, that is,
# to match tree shadows with their tree crowns.  Once a match is determined, calculate the tree carbon stock.
# A new feature database consisting of both the tree crowns and shadows will be stored (multipolygon).
# Equations to be provided.
