    "### Overview \n",
    "Start by labeling/annotating a part of the satellite images with the trees or any other object of interest. Store the labels in shapefiles. The areas that are labeled/annotated are denoted by the 'training area' and actual trees or the object of interests in that area are denoted by the 'training polygons'. The word annotation and label are used interchangeably in this code. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, first, we read the training area and the training polygons from two separate shape files. Then we determine the training area for each training polygon and generate a weighted boundary for each training area. \n",
    "Next, we read the raw satellite images (ndvi and pan channel), and from each satellite image, we extract areas that overlap with a training area. The part of the ndvi and pan image that overlap with the training area and the corresponding label/annotation and boundary weights are then written to separate files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the term training area and training polygon represent all available input data, which can then be separated into training, validation, and test sets in the next notebook(s). "
